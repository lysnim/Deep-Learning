# Deep-Learning
Here is all my progress through the arduous task of learning deep learning algorithms.

## Body-brain Weight
It explores the relationship between the weight of the body and the weight of the brain of the organism.

#### Libraries
- Panda: a library in order to input, organize and manipulate data.
- Sklearn: a library with simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- matplotlib: to plot data as we do in Matlab.

#### Process
1. With panda we read the data and it returns a Dataframe type.
2. We select the x_values and the y_values indexed with the two first values.
3. With sklearn we create a linear regression model.
4. With sklearn we fit our linear model to the x and y values.
5. We scatter the points into the plot.
6. We add the line of our prediction.
7. We show our plot.

## Gradient descent
It computes the optimized straight line that has the least amount of error.
