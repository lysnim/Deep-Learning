Here is all my progress through the arduous task of learning deep learning algorithms.

# Table of Contents
1. [Linear Regression Model](#body-brain-weight)
2. [Gradient Descent](#gradient-descent)

## Body-brain Weight
It explores the relationship between the weight of the body and the weight of the brain of the organism.

### Libraries
- [panda](http://pandas.pydata.org): a library in order to input, organize and manipulate data.
- [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org): a library with simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org): to plot data as we do in Matlab.

### Process
1. With panda we read the data and it returns a Dataframe type.
2. We select the x_values and the y_values indexed with the two first values.
3. With sklearn we create a linear regression model.
4. With sklearn we fit our linear model to the x and y values.
5. We scatter the points into the plot.
6. We add the line of our prediction.
7. We show our plot.

## Gradient Descent
It computes the optimized straight line that has the least amount of error.

## Neural Network
